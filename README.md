# Interactive Book Cover Part I
**What book did you choose? What is it about?**  
I chose the book “How the mole got his pants”, a Czech childhood classic I was introduced to in kindergarten. Although this was first published as a short film, I got to know the story through a book. The book is about a little mole who sees a pair of overall pants on a laundry line. He becomes obsessed with the idea of getting a pair of such pants for himself, but does not know how to get them. As he searches and asks other animals for help, they tell him they can help him make those pants, all they’d need is a piece of fabric. The little mole struggles to find fabric, until the flax seed plant tells the little mole that if he helps take care of the plant, it will, in turn, help him turn flax into fibers and other animals will help him wave the fabric for his pants. In the end, the mole gets pants with big pockets, which he’s very happy about.
  
**What aspect of the book will you include in your cover?**  
I would like to include the vibrant background – possibly with some animation, where the plants would be wavering in the wind, the little mole himself, as well as 3 of the animals that helped him.
  
**Is it interactive? time-based? Both?**  
I am not yet sure which it should be, perhaps interactive. I would like the animals to come into the frame and help the little mole one by one. With each animal, the little mole will get a portion of his pants (1) threads (2) fabric scraps (3) final pants.
  
I took the concept into Procreate, and used the original book illustrations and sketching tools to map out the flow of the interaction.
	  

**What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?**  
I think being able to code all of the components I want to + actually making visually appealing illustrations will be a big challenge here. It is almost like I am making a game. I would like the movements to look organic and playful.

**Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we’ve done?**  
At first glance, this project makes me think about the interaction reading (might also be a recency bias), but I am wondering whether having people click is considered enough of an interaction, and whether or not I’d even call this interactive?
